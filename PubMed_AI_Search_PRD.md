## 6. Application Workflow
### **Find Tab Workflow**
1. User enters a query in the search bar.  
2. Backend queries the PubMed API to fetch relevant papers and abstracts.  
3. Cohere summarizes abstracts and extracts key insights.  
4. Results are displayed in a list format with summaries, filters, and sort options.  

### **Chat Tab Workflow**
1. User specifies a paper via PubMed ID or search result selection.  
2. Backend fetches the paperâ€™s abstract or full text (if available).  
3. Cohere processes the document to create embeddings stored in Pinecone/Qdrant.  
4. User asks questions; backend retrieves relevant content using the embeddings and responds via Cohere.  

### **Data Flow**
1. **Supabase:** Store user data, saved queries, and interactions.  
2. **Redis:** Cache frequently accessed API responses and AI-generated summaries.  
3. **FastAPI Backend:** Handles all API calls and orchestrates AI processing.

## 7. Success Metrics (KPIs)
- **Search Relevance:** Percentage of searches returning relevant results.  
- **Summarization Quality:** User ratings for AI-generated summaries.  
- **User Engagement:** Average time spent per session.  
- **Retention Rate:** Percentage of returning users.  
- **Query Speed:** Average response time for search and chat queries.
