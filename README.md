## 6. Application Workflow
### **Find Tab Workflow**
1. User enters a query in the search bar.  
2. Backend queries the PubMed API to fetch relevant papers and abstracts.  
3. GPT4o summarizes abstracts and extracts key insights.  
4. Results are displayed in a list format with summaries, filters, and sort options.  

### **Chat Tab Workflow**
1. User specifies a paper via search result selection.  
2. Backend fetches the paperâ€™s abstract or full text (if available).  
3. GPT4o processes the document to create embeddings stored in Pinecone/Qdrant.  
4. User asks questions; backend retrieves relevant content
